--Readme document for *YOUR NAME*, *YOUR_EMAIL@uci.edu*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

*/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 2/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
At least one image with descriptive alt text
Multiple pages with appropriate navigation between them
Links to external pages


(b) CSS features
Modifying link color, text color, and additional colors to be more appealing.
Adding custom fonts from Google fonts, with fallbacks.


(c) Advanced features
Navigation bar



3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.



4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
Around 8 hours, given all the time I spent looking at other sources, prompting, and taking breaks to make sure I understood the material.


5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)
In addition to class resources (slides, recordings), I made use of W3schools (w3schools.com) explanations regarding various HTML tags. Furthermore, I  did use generative AI to query on the correctness of my code in addition to asking it to help clarify certain aspects of the assignment, such as what semantic code design is.
I also used code completion in regards to coding this as I have gemini enabled in the environnment I developed my portfolio, which was VSCode. I additionally queried it to do certain tasks I was not familiar with, such as helping me connect it to the GitHub repository and run a preview of the portfolio that I could see and test. 

I used this tutorial to make my home page, altering it to fit my own specifications.
https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_hero_image.asp

Prompted AI to help simplify what I was reading at this link (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/navbar/) so I could simplify it for my own purposes as a navbar.

I prompted AI over common button css choices, and chose my favorite out of several iterations, also altering it to suit my more favored color choices.

I got the lorem ipsum place holder text from here: https://www.lipsum.com/feed/html.

6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
I did not consult other classmates about this assignment at all.


7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
I do not believe so, but perhaps you will need to download the images I am using? I am unfortunately not familiar. I did use a script from bootstrap
in order to make my navbar, but I believe it should run. I additionally tried to make a mailto link, but unfortunately it is still not working.
